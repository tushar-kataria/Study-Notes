Study Notes for Everyone
Hey everyone, while scrolling the feed of linkedin I found a post where it was written notes for various topics. I opened the link and boom found amazing notes for different topics like python, C++, React, even Git and many more. Although I did not downloaded all of them, just the ones I need. So, I am sharing those notes for you. I really don't know who those belong to so not giving any copyright or credits. Its for everyone so it really doesn't matter.
Thanks.
